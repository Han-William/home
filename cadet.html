			<span class="cadets">What is Air Cadets?</span> Royal Canadian Air Cadets is an extracurricular program that I am apart of. 
			The aim of the program is to foster an interst in aviation,
			to get youths fit at a young age and to build leadership skills. There are many clubs within the Cadets&rsquo;s program such as the drill team, biathlon and effective speeking to name a few.
			The end goal of the program for any young air cadet is to learn how to fly a plane. There are many lessons in the Air Cadet program that teaches everything one needs to know about a plane and they are 
			truly fascinating. Meetings are usually on Tuesdays at six fourty&ndash;five.

			<span class="cadets">What are my experiences in the Air Cadets program?</span>I am part of the 110 Black Hawk Squadron and my experiences in the program were net positive by a long
			shot. I was able to learn about things that just dosen&rsquo;t cross your mind often. I was also able to attend the field training exercise in November, 2019. It was the second time
			in my life that I was able to see the stars in the sky. Before the Covid crisis I took part in the effective speaking competition and it was quite memorable. 
			Even during the Covid-crisis I took part in two virtual summer courses one on drone piloting and one on Effective Speaking. This year I have been taking part in virtual meets hosted by 
			the squadron and am still learning skills. Those skills incude polishing boots and ironing uniforms amongst other things. I own many things to the Royal Canadian Air Cadets and I always
			by the motto of &quot; Spirit, Effort, Success&quot;.
